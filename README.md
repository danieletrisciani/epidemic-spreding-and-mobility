# Epidemics spreading: modelling & integration with mobility

##About the project

## Used databases

* https://github.com/MatteoHenryChinaski/Comuni-Italiani-2018-Sql-Json-excel/blob/master/italy_cities.json. This database stores some information about italian cities, I used it to get all the cities with a population greater than 60 thousand.
* https://github.com/MatteoHenryChinaski/Comuni-Italiani-2018-Sql-Json-excel/blob/master/italy_geo.json. This database links latitude and longitude to the corresponding city. These informations are used to calculate the distance between the cities to estimate how much a city can influence another city.
* https://openflights.org/data.html. There are two database of interests in there: airports.dat, this database stores some information about all the airport in the world, we are interested in the IATA code that uniquely identifies the airport. routes.dat, that stores all the routes between the airports all over the world using the IATA code. It is used to estimate how the airports in Italy are connected with airports abroad.
